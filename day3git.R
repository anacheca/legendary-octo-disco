#to create this is new folder version control, git and copy the code in git
#in envi go to git and click - so push to add and commit button

#add more stuff and upload
#more stuff
#every time we made a new version of pdf git saves a new version of it and all pdf get hidden everytime you change them and commit
#in those cases do .gitignore and write a *.pdf or *.png (delete everthing that finish in .png) and check in env gir if it does appear
#eg. not add raw data - row-data/*
#you can revert the changes by going to more and revert
#rebase to delete stuff on the middle
